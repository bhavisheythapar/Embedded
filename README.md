# About
This repository conatins code for some of the standalone hardware projects that I have worked on to get a better understanding of embedded and control systems. 

## List Of Projects

### 1. Temperature Control Embedded System
This project uses a Romeo microcontroller and a Temperature Control Board to regulate the temperature of a 12V bulb using a PD controller. More details about this project can be found on my [website](https://bhavisheythapar.com/blog-temperatureControl.html).
